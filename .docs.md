## Detection Parameters

### Blink Detection Configuration

The system uses three key parameters to accurately detect and count eye blinks. These parameters can be configured through environment variables to fine-tune the detection sensitivity.

#### MIN_BLINK_FRAMES
- **Default Value:** 3
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Defines the minimum number of consecutive frames where eyes must be detected as closed to count as a genuine blink.
- **Impact:**
  - Lower values (1-2): More sensitive detection but higher risk of false positives
  - Higher values (4+): More reliable detection but might miss quick blinks
  - Default (3): Balanced setting that filters noise while catching most real blinks
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting too many false blink detections
  - Decrease if missing obvious blinks
  - Adjust based on video frame rate and typical blink patterns

#### BLINK_COOLDOWN
- **Default Value:** 15
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** The number of frames to wait after detecting a blink before allowing another blink to be counted.
- **Impact:**
  - At 30 FPS, default (15) equals approximately 0.5 seconds cooldown
  - Prevents double-counting of single blink events
  - Helps distinguish between separate blink events
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting duplicate counts for single blinks
  - Decrease if missing closely spaced blinks
  - Consider video frame rate when adjusting

#### EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE
- **Default Value:** 0.6
- **Type:** Float (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Description:** The confidence threshold that the YOLO model must exceed to consider an eye as "closed".
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (0.7-0.9): More certain detections but may miss some cases
  - Lower values (0.3-0.5): More sensitive but increased false positives
  - Default (0.6): Balanced threshold for most conditions
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting false detections in challenging lighting
  - Decrease if missing obvious eye closures
  - Consider environmental conditions (lighting, video quality)

#### Implementation Example
```python
# In yolo_processor.py
closed_eyes = result.boxes[result.boxes.cls == 0]
confident_detections = closed_eyes[closed_eyes.conf >= self.confidence_threshold]

if len(confident_detections) > 0:
    potential_blink_frames += 1
    consecutive_eye_closed += 1
else:
    if potential_blink_frames >= self.min_blink_frames and blink_cooldown_counter == 0:
        eye_closed_frames += 1
        blink_cooldown_counter = self.blink_cooldown
    potential_blink_frames = 0
    consecutive_eye_closed = 0
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default values
2. Monitor detection accuracy in your specific use case
3. Adjust one parameter at a time and observe impact
4. Consider relationships between parameters:
   - Higher `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES` might need lower `BLINK_COOLDOWN`
   - Lower `EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE` might need higher `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES`

### Drowsiness Threshold Configuration

The system uses three primary thresholds to determine drowsiness states based on yawning frequency, eye closure duration, and normal state detection.

#### DROWSINESS_THRESHOLD_YAWN
- **Default Value:** 6
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** The number of yawns within the analysis window that indicates drowsiness.
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>8): More tolerant of frequent yawning, fewer false positives
  - Lower values (<4): More sensitive to yawning patterns, earlier warnings
  - Default (6): Balanced setting suitable for most driving conditions
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting false alerts during normal fatigue
  - Decrease for safety-critical operations
  - Consider time of day and shift duration
- **Relationship with other parameters:**
  - Works in conjunction with `FETCH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to determine yawn frequency
  - May need adjustment when changing `FETCH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`

#### DROWSINESS_THRESHOLD_EYE_CLOSED
- **Default Value:** 35
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** The number of frames where eyes must be detected as closed to indicate drowsiness.
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>40): More tolerant of prolonged eye closure
  - Lower values (<30): More sensitive to brief eye closures
  - Default (35): Balanced for typical microsleep detection
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting false positives during normal blinking
  - Decrease for higher-risk environments
  - Consider video frame rate and lighting conditions
- **Relationship with other parameters:**
  - Works alongside `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES` and `BLINK_COOLDOWN`
  - Higher values might need higher `BLINK_COOLDOWN`
  - Consider adjusting with `EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE`

#### DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 60
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** The percentage of frames where normal state must be detected to reduce drowsiness likelihood.
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>70): More strict requirement for normal state detection
  - Lower values (<50): More lenient in considering normal state
  - Default (60): Balanced threshold for typical scenarios
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting too many false negatives (missed drowsiness)
  - Decrease if getting too many false positives in alert states
  - Consider environmental conditions and camera setup
- **Relationship with other parameters:**
  - Works inversely with drowsiness detection
  - Higher values make drowsiness detection more sensitive
  - Lower values make the system more conservative in drowsiness detection

#### Implementation Example
```python
# In drowsiness_analyzer.py
def analyze(self, yawn_count, eye_closed_frames, normal_state_frames, total_frames):
    # Calculate normal state percentage
    normal_state_percentage = (normal_state_frames / total_frames) * 100
    
    # Consider normal state in drowsiness detection
    is_normal = normal_state_percentage > self.normal_state_threshold
    
    if is_normal:
        is_drowsy = False
        confidence = 0.3  # Low confidence when normal state detected
    else:
        is_drowsy = is_drowsy_eyes or is_drowsy_yawns
        confidence = max(eye_confidence, yawn_confidence)
        confidence *= (1 - (normal_state_percentage / 100))
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default threshold (60%)
2. Monitor detection accuracy:
   - False positives: Normal state being missed
   - False negatives: Drowsiness being missed
3. Adjust based on:
   - Camera position and quality
   - Lighting conditions
   - Driver characteristics
   - Vehicle environment
4. Consider relationships between parameters:
   - Higher normal state threshold with lower drowsiness thresholds
   - Balance with `EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE`
   - Adjust with `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES`

#### Use Cases
- **Highway driving:**
  - Higher `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (65-70)
  - More strict normal state requirement
- **Urban driving:**
  - Lower `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (55-60)
  - More frequent state changes expected
- **Night driving:**
  - Medium-high `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (60-65)
  - Compensate for challenging lighting

## Analysis Algorithms

### Rate-Based Analyzer

The Rate-Based Analyzer implements a time-aware approach to drowsiness detection by analyzing the frequency and duration of drowsiness indicators over time.

#### Configuration Parameters

##### EYE_CLOSED_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 20
- **Type:** Float
- **Description:** The percentage of time eyes must be closed to indicate drowsiness
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>25%): More tolerant of closed eyes, fewer false positives
  - Lower values (<15%): More sensitive to eye closure patterns
  - Default (20%): Balanced for typical drowsy behavior
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase for environments with more natural eye closure
  - Decrease for safety-critical applications
  - Consider lighting conditions and camera position

##### YAWN_RATE_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 3
- **Type:** Float
- **Description:** Number of yawns per minute that indicates drowsiness
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>4): Requires more frequent yawning to trigger
  - Lower values (<2): More sensitive to occasional yawns
  - Default (3): Typical drowsy yawning frequency
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase for longer monitoring periods
  - Decrease for short-duration monitoring
  - Consider time of day and driver fatigue patterns

##### FPS (Frames Per Second)
- **Default Value:** 30
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Video frame rate used for time-based calculations
- **Impact:**
  - Must match actual video input frame rate
  - Used to convert frame counts to real-time measurements
  - Critical for accurate rate calculations

#### Analysis Method

The analyzer employs two parallel approaches:

1. **Eye Closure Analysis:**
   - Calculates percentage of time eyes are closed
   - Formula: `(eye_closed_frames / total_frames) * 100`
   - Compares against `eye_closed_percentage_threshold`

2. **Yawn Frequency Analysis:**
   - Calculates yawns per minute
   - Formula: `yawn_count / (total_frames / (fps * 60))`
   - Compares against `yawn_rate_threshold`

#### Confidence Calculation

Confidence scores are calculated independently for each metric:
- Eye closure confidence: `min(eye_closed_percentage / threshold, 1.0)`
- Yawn confidence: `min(yawn_rate / threshold, 1.0)`
- Final confidence: Maximum of both scores

#### Implementation Example
```python
# Time-based metrics calculation
time_in_seconds = total_frames / self.fps
time_in_minutes = time_in_seconds / 60
eye_closed_percentage = (eye_closed_frames / total_frames) * 100
yawn_rate_per_minute = yawn_count / time_in_minutes

# Drowsiness determination
is_drowsy_eyes = eye_closed_percentage > self.eye_closed_percentage_threshold
is_drowsy_yawns = yawn_rate_per_minute > self.yawn_rate_threshold
is_drowsy = is_drowsy_eyes or is_drowsy_yawns
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default thresholds
2. Monitor false positive/negative rates
3. Adjust based on:
   - Environmental conditions
   - Time of day
   - Driver characteristics
   - Safety requirements
4. Consider relationships:
   - Higher eye closure threshold might need lower yawn rate threshold
   - Adjust both metrics based on monitoring duration

#### Use Cases
- **Long-haul driving:** Higher thresholds for sustained monitoring
- **Safety-critical operations:** Lower thresholds for early warning
- **Variable conditions:** Dynamic threshold adjustment based on time/conditions
