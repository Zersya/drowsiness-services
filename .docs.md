## Detection Parameters

### Blink Detection Configuration

The system uses three key parameters to accurately detect and count eye blinks. These parameters can be configured through environment variables to fine-tune the detection sensitivity.

#### MIN_BLINK_FRAMES
- **Default Value:** 3
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Defines the minimum number of consecutive frames where eyes must be detected as closed to count as a genuine blink.
- **Impact:**
  - Lower values (1-2): More sensitive detection but higher risk of false positives
  - Higher values (4+): More reliable detection but might miss quick blinks
  - Default (3): Balanced setting that filters noise while catching most real blinks
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting too many false blink detections
  - Decrease if missing obvious blinks
  - Adjust based on video frame rate and typical blink patterns

#### BLINK_COOLDOWN
- **Default Value:** 15
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** The number of frames to wait after detecting a blink before allowing another blink to be counted.
- **Impact:**
  - At 30 FPS, default (15) equals approximately 0.5 seconds cooldown
  - Prevents double-counting of single blink events
  - Helps distinguish between separate blink events
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting duplicate counts for single blinks
  - Decrease if missing closely spaced blinks
  - Consider video frame rate when adjusting

#### EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE
- **Default Value:** 0.6
- **Type:** Float (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Description:** The confidence threshold that the YOLO model must exceed to consider an eye as "closed".
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (0.7-0.9): More certain detections but may miss some cases
  - Lower values (0.3-0.5): More sensitive but increased false positives
  - Default (0.6): Balanced threshold for most conditions
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase if getting false detections in challenging lighting
  - Decrease if missing obvious eye closures
  - Consider environmental conditions (lighting, video quality)

#### Implementation Example
```python
# In yolo_processor.py
closed_eyes = result.boxes[result.boxes.cls == 0]
confident_detections = closed_eyes[closed_eyes.conf >= self.confidence_threshold]

if len(confident_detections) > 0:
    potential_blink_frames += 1
    consecutive_eye_closed += 1
else:
    if potential_blink_frames >= self.min_blink_frames and blink_cooldown_counter == 0:
        eye_closed_frames += 1
        blink_cooldown_counter = self.blink_cooldown
    potential_blink_frames = 0
    consecutive_eye_closed = 0
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default values
2. Monitor detection accuracy in your specific use case
3. Adjust one parameter at a time and observe impact
4. Consider relationships between parameters:
   - Higher `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES` might need lower `BLINK_COOLDOWN`
   - Lower `EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE` might need higher `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES`

#### Implementation Example
```python
# In drowsiness_analyzer.py
def analyze(self, yawn_count, eye_closed_frames, normal_state_frames, total_frames):
    # Calculate normal state percentage
    normal_state_percentage = (normal_state_frames / total_frames) * 100
    
    # Consider normal state in drowsiness detection
    is_normal = normal_state_percentage > self.normal_state_threshold
    
    if is_normal:
        is_drowsy = False
        confidence = 0.3  # Low confidence when normal state detected
    else:
        is_drowsy = is_drowsy_eyes or is_drowsy_yawns
        confidence = max(eye_confidence, yawn_confidence)
        confidence *= (1 - (normal_state_percentage / 100))
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default threshold (60%)
2. Monitor detection accuracy:
   - False positives: Normal state being missed
   - False negatives: Drowsiness being missed
3. Adjust based on:
   - Camera position and quality
   - Lighting conditions
   - Driver characteristics
   - Vehicle environment
4. Consider relationships between parameters:
   - Higher normal state threshold with lower drowsiness thresholds
   - Balance with `EYE_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE`
   - Adjust with `MIN_BLINK_FRAMES`

#### Use Cases
- **Highway driving:**
  - Higher `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (65-70)
  - More strict normal state requirement
- **Urban driving:**
  - Lower `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (55-60)
  - More frequent state changes expected
- **Night driving:**
  - Medium-high `DROWSINESS_NORMAL_STATE_THRESHOLD` (60-65)
  - Compensate for challenging lighting

## Analysis Algorithms

### Rate-Based Analyzer

The Rate-Based Analyzer implements a time-aware approach to drowsiness detection by analyzing the frequency and duration of drowsiness indicators over time.

#### Configuration Parameters

##### EYE_CLOSED_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 20
- **Type:** Float
- **Description:** The percentage of time eyes must be closed to indicate drowsiness
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>25%): More tolerant of closed eyes, fewer false positives
  - Lower values (<15%): More sensitive to eye closure patterns
  - Default (20%): Balanced for typical drowsy behavior
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase for environments with more natural eye closure
  - Decrease for safety-critical applications
  - Consider lighting conditions and camera position

##### YAWN_RATE_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 3
- **Type:** Float
- **Description:** Number of yawns per minute that indicates drowsiness
- **Impact:**
  - Higher values (>4): Requires more frequent yawning to trigger
  - Lower values (<2): More sensitive to occasional yawns
  - Default (3): Typical drowsy yawning frequency
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase for longer monitoring periods
  - Decrease for short-duration monitoring
  - Consider time of day and driver fatigue patterns

##### FPS (Frames Per Second)
- **Default Value:** 30
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Video frame rate used for time-based calculations
- **Impact:**
  - Must match actual video input frame rate
  - Used to convert frame counts to real-time measurements
  - Critical for accurate rate calculations

##### MINIMUM_YAWN_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 1
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Minimum number of yawns required before considering yawn-based drowsiness detection
- **Impact:**
  - Acts as a baseline requirement for yawn detection
  - Must be met along with `yawn_rate_threshold` for yawn-based drowsiness
  - Used in confidence calculation normalization
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase to reduce false positives from occasional yawns
  - Keep low (1-2) for sensitive detection
  - Consider environmental factors (e.g., time of day, driver fatigue patterns)

##### MINIMUM_EYE_CLOSED_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 1
- **Type:** Integer
- **Description:** Minimum number of frames where eyes must be detected as closed
- **Impact:**
  - Part of three-way condition for eye-based drowsiness detection
  - Works in conjunction with percentage and duration thresholds
  - Used in confidence score calculation
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Increase for more strict detection
  - Decrease (minimum 1) for maximum sensitivity
  - Balance with other eye closure metrics

##### MAX_CLOSURE_DURATION_THRESHOLD
- **Default Value:** 0.3
- **Type:** Float
- **Description:** Maximum duration (in seconds) of continuous eye closure before indicating drowsiness
- **Impact:**
  - Helps identify prolonged eye closures and microsleep episodes
  - Independent of percentage-based metrics
  - Critical for detecting severe drowsiness events
- **When to Adjust:**
  - Lower values (0.2-0.3): More sensitive to brief closures
  - Higher values (0.4+): More tolerant of longer closures
  - Consider normal blink duration (typically 0.1-0.4 seconds)

#### Analysis Method

The analyzer employs multiple parallel approaches:

1. **Eye Closure Analysis:**
   - Percentage of time eyes are closed
   - Maximum continuous closure duration
   - Minimum frame count threshold
   - Formula: Any of these conditions can trigger drowsiness detection:
     ```python
     is_drowsy_eyes = (
         eye_closed_percentage > eye_closed_percentage_threshold OR
         max_closure_duration > max_closure_duration_threshold OR
         eye_closed_frames >= minimum_eye_closed_threshold
     )
     ```

2. **Yawn Frequency Analysis:**
   - Normal Drowsy Yawning (`is_drowsy_yawns`):
     - Requires minimum yawn count (â‰¥ 1 yawn)
     - AND yawn rate above threshold (> 3 yawns/minute)
     - Formula:
       ```python
       is_drowsy_yawns = (
           yawn_count >= minimum_yawn_threshold AND
           yawn_rate_per_minute > yawn_rate_threshold
       )
       ```
   - Excessive Yawning (`is_drowsy_excessive_yawns`):
     - Indicates severe drowsiness
     - Triggered by either:
       * More than 10 total yawns
       * OR extremely high yawn rate (> 100 yawns/minute)
     - Formula:
       ```python
       is_drowsy_excessive_yawns = (
           yawn_count > 10 OR
           yawn_rate_per_minute > 100
       )
       ```
     - When triggered, sets confidence to 1.0 (highest severity)

3. **Confidence Calculation:**
   - Eye-based confidence using three metrics:
     - Percentage-based confidence
     - Duration-based confidence
     - Frame count-based confidence
   - Yawn-based confidence
   - Normal state adjustment
   - Final confidence calculation prioritizes eye metrics (70%) over yawn metrics (30%)

#### Implementation Example
```python
# Time-based metrics calculation
time_in_seconds = total_frames / self.fps
time_in_minutes = time_in_seconds / 60
eye_closed_percentage = (eye_closed_frames / total_frames) * 100
yawn_rate_per_minute = yawn_count / time_in_minutes

# Drowsiness determination
is_drowsy_eyes = eye_closed_percentage > self.eye_closed_percentage_threshold
is_drowsy_yawns = yawn_rate_per_minute > self.yawn_rate_threshold
is_drowsy = is_drowsy_eyes or is_drowsy_yawns
```

#### Configuration Guidelines
1. Start with default thresholds
2. Monitor false positive/negative rates
3. Adjust based on:
   - Environmental conditions
   - Time of day
   - Driver characteristics
   - Safety requirements
4. Consider relationships:
   - Higher eye closure threshold might need lower yawn rate threshold
   - Adjust both metrics based on monitoring duration

#### Use Cases
- **Long-haul driving:** Higher thresholds for sustained monitoring
- **Safety-critical operations:** Lower thresholds for early warning
- **Variable conditions:** Dynamic threshold adjustment based on time/conditions
